This app has been built with college students interested in fashion in mind.
Imagine a college student or a future one obsessed with fashion and brands, who wants to know what are the trending/most popular brands in a campus; collegeRunway will be here to help!!

This app, will tell the user the most trending brands (in Tops, Bottoms, Shoes and Accessories) in a chosen college.

The app will work in two ways:

 - Giving back to the user the most poular brand in the selected college.

CollegeRunway could also be used by any company who would want to know the trend in a college for business purposes!!

## How to find the most trending brands!
The app lets users select the name of their college/university and the season they want to choose. 
Upon submitting the choices, the user is taken to the season page corresponding to the selection made.

The user then select the favorite brands under different fashion category and submits.

Once the app gets all the feedback from the particular school selected by the user, it will display the most popular or trending brand for that specific university!!!


## How is CollegeRunway built
The app is built with HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
The app will store every entry in the database, and updates and retrieves as requested!
All the informations concerning the user are stored in the userTable.

_The userTable is built as a look up table which means _it hold data in the form of key values. All the columns of the userTable (except the Id) are foreign keys from other tables_

Once the user select an university and a season, these 2 informations are stored in the userTable with an unique Id to define the user
Then, the user access to the season page to select the brands. Once the user submit the choosen brands, the row corresponding to the id of the user is updated with all the brands.
Since the userTable contains only key values, it is then joined with the "parents" tables to get the data that will be displayed.

To do so, __views__ are used. The views _which are virtual tables resulting of a SQL statement_ will help avoid the use of long queries inside the program and will make the maintenance easier.
