# College Runway

OVERVIEW
We have built an app called "CollegeRunway" with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. It uses Node and MySQL to query,Express package to handle routing, and Handlebars to generate HTML. CollegeRunway is an app dedicated to college students who are interested in Fashion and want to know the most trending brand in their college.I t will give to the user the top most popular brand of clothing (Bottom, Top, Shoes and accessories) in a chosen college.
The app will work in two ways:
Getting the input from the user about their favorite brands according to seasons.
Giving them back the most poular brand in their campus
The final app is deployed to Heroku for other users to view and use in real time!

FOLDER STRUCTURE
For this app, I have followed an specified folder structre by following MVC requirements.

HOW THE APP WORKS!
The app lets users input the name of their college/university and the season they want to choose. Upon submitting the button, they are taken to the seasons page of their choice.
Student then inputs their favorite brands under different fashion category and submits.
Once the app gets all the feedback from the particular school's student, our app CollegeRunway will display the most popular or trending brand for that specific university!!!
The app will store every entry in the database, and updates and retrieves as requested!

DEPLOYMENT AND HOSTING ON HEROKU
The app is deployed on Heroku hosting server so other studens should be able to provide their feedback about their favorite brands and the final result will show them the popular brand in their college in a particular season.
